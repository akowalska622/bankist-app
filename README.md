# Bankist App created during Jonas Schmedtmann's course

This is the simple banking app, which was created within the scope of Jonas Schmedtmann's JS course. The project was implemented during the arrays section and arrays' methods, especially **callback** funtctions within them.

HTML and CSS code **isn't mine** - it was already provided by Jonas.
JS boilerplate (grabbing all elements in DOM and creating object with users) also was provided initially.

Since line 65 of _script.js_ file the code is mostly mine, but checked with videos. Nevertheless, I don't code along with Jonas - since he explains the logic in current task, I pause the video and code by myself. Sometimes I implement improvements after seeing video with Jonas' code, sometimes I leave my own code.

## How to use app

Firstly, you need to log in. There's no backend, the logging function is simply made by changing opacity of the _app_ element.
There are four users:

Account 1 login: js
Account 1 password: 1111

Account 2 login: jd
Account 2 passowrd = 2222

Account 3 login = stw
Account 3 password = 3333

Account 4 login = ss
Account 4 password = 4444

After succesfull logging in, you're able to make withdrawal, deposits and send money to another **existing** user. If you change the account to another user, the pervious transfer will be displayed.
